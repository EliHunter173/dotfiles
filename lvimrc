" This is Eli W. Hunter's lvim or 'Light Vim' configuration.
"
" Light Vim is my solution to wanting to use Neovim as my primary 'IDE' text
" editor while also wanting to use a command line vi-like text editor for
" basic editing where lightness matters most. I could have installed Vim alongside
" Neovim and used Vim's .vimrc. However, I like Neovim's defaults more, and it
" seemed wasteful to have both Neovim and Vim installed.
"
" So, I opted for creating 'Light Vim' which is just Neovim with this as its config
" file.
"
" This config file should be extremely lightweight and include only the bare
" minimums.
