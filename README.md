# Eli's Dotfiles

This repository serves as a storage for all my config files, making it easier to
set up and maintain my setup across multiple computers. Feel free to read through
and copy as you wish!

This is managed by [Dotbot](https://git.io/dotbot).

## Features

* Only somewhat outdated documentation!
* Pretty base16 colors

### Shell

* (Oh My) Zsh!
* Auto-completion
* Syntax highlighting
* Easier `sudo`!

### Vim

* Light vim (`lvim`) when you need to edit at hyper-speed
* A lean, mean, IDE-light [Neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) config
  * Enhanced status bar with [airline](https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline)
  * Fast buffer, file, tag searching with [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf.vim)
  * Small, quality-of-life keybindings

## Misc. Notes

* Default umask `027` for moderate security.
